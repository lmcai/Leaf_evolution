# Time tree of Orobanchaceae

The backbone of the time tree is derived from [Mortimer et al 2022](https://doi.org/10.1600/036364422X16512564801560). We expanded taxon sampling within Agalinis following [Latvis et al 2024](https://doi.org/10.1600/036364424X17095905880222), Brandisia following [Chen et al 2022](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pld.2023.03.005), Lamrourouxia following [Mortimer 2019](chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://objects.lib.uidaho.edu/etd/pdf/Mortimer_idaho_0089N_11516.pdf).


To merge these clade-specific phylogenies with the Orobanchaceae family-wise time tree (referred to as the mortimer tree), we conducted individual divergence time estimation for each clade using the secondary calibration from the mortimer tree in `TreePL`. We primed, cross validated, and conducted thorough time tree search in `TreePL`. This step need to be done for Agalinis and Lamourouxia.
