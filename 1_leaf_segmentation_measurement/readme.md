# Leaf outline analysis

These MatLab codes are intended to process RGB images of leaf to extract their outline and analyse it using EFD.

## I. Segment leaf outline from images of chemically stained leaves

1. Use `cleared_leaf_image_segmentation.m` to convert images to binary masks.

2. Rotate the black-white mask to get dimension measurements
  
   - Place all images in a folder and call the function `batch_rotate_images(folder_path)` to rotate image. This function will write a rotated image `rotated_*` to the folder
   - Manual inspect the rotated leaves, heart shaped leaves can be tricky. Place these leaves need to be manually rotated in one folder and use `batch_rotate_images_manual(folder_path)`. This should generate a png file `rotated_*.png` where the main axis is placed vertically.
   - For dissected leaves, use the function `batch_rotate_dissected_leaf(folder_path)`, which will not fill holes.
   - Some images are upside down, they need to be manually sorted into one folder and use the following script to rotate the image for 180 degree.
```
image_files = dir(fullfile(folder_path, 'rotate*.png'));
for i = 1:numel(image_files)
	img = imread(fullfile(folder_path, image_files(i).name));
	% Rotate the image 180 degrees
	rotated_img = imrotate(img, 180, 'bilinear');
	imwrite(rotated_img,fullfile(folder_path, image_files(i).name))
```

3. Once satisfied with the orientation of the leaf images, place them in one folder. Then measure the dimension of the leaves using the command `batch_dimension_measurement('folder_name')`.

This will generate a 'leaf_dimension' file with the following five metrics: 

```
Area = total leaf area in pixel
Length = vertital axis length in pixel
Width = horizontal axis length in pixel
Aspect ratio = width/length
Solidity = area/convex_hull
Ellipticalness Index = 4 * Area / (Ï€ * L * W)
Circularity = 4 * pi * area/parimeter^2
```
The outline coordinate `*.tsv` file is a list of x and y coordinates of the outline of the leaf. They can be used by Momocs (R package) for EFD analysis.


# II. Segment leaf outline from digitized specimens obtained from GBIF


To expand genus-level taxon sampling across Orobanchaceae as well as taxon-level sampling for several focal genera, we extracted leaf outline data from digitized specimens. 

If using herbarium specimen image, use `specimen_img_trace_to_individual_bw_mask.m` to segment individual leaves.


# III. Fractal dimension as a measurement of leaf dissection

Initially I want to use the fractal dimension to quantify how 'dissected' a leaf is, but I found it not useful in my case. But for those who are interested, use the function `fractal_dimension` to calculate a value for each individual leaf image.
```
folder_path = 'path_to_images';
image_files = dir(fullfile(folder_path, 'rotate*.png'));
leaf_fd = ["ID" "fd"];
for i = 1:numel(image_files)
	curr_fd=fractal_dimension(fullfile(folder_path, image_files(i).name));
	leaf_fd = vertcat(leaf_fd, [image_files(i).name string(curr_fd)]);
end

filename = 'leaf_fractal_dimention.csv';
writematrix(leaf_fd, filename);

```
