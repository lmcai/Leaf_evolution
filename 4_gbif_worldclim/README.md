# GBIF distribution and abiotic data extraction

1. Use `stardardize_species_names.R` to standardize and correct species names recorded from the specimens

2. Use `CoordinateCleaner.R` to clean up occurrence records and generate maps that can be manually inspected

3. Use `worldclim.R` to extract temprature and precipitation data.
